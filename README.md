# jira-pile-of-poo-web-ext

A browser extension for chrome and firefox decorating Jira tickets in Agile Boards with a smelly pile of poo per day in column.

## Installing the distribution

## Getting started with development

    web-ext run

See upstream documentation for the details:

* [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) is a helpful tool to automate the lifecycle of firefox extensions
* [Temporary installation in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) is the manual alternative

## Limitations

While Web Extensions are in principle portable between browsers with minor adjustments, the Jira Pile of Poo extension has not been ported yet. We are happy for pull requests in case you do it.
